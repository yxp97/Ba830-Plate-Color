# Ba830-Plate-Color
Our goal is to determine if the color of the plate that the food is served on affects whether people want to eat the food. Based on the results we can give recommendations to restaurants to improve their advertisements and attract more people. 
We created two surveys and used simple randomization to randomize at the person level to put each person into the treatment group or control group with different surveys. For each survey, we have basic demographic information such as gender, country and age group to see if any of this information may also affect the plate they choose. We also have 10 questions in each survey related to our experiment. 
In these questions, We asked people to select which food looks tastier based on the photos. We have ten different foods in total and for each question we display the same food but different food pictures on red or white plates. We randomized for each question if the red plate will be on the right or left and set the treatment survey opposite the plate color order for each question. We tested if people are more likely to choose the food based on the plate color, food itself or the position of the food.
